# MangaHabu
A side project I decided to do to start learning frameworks and just practice in general as well as web dev stuff. Also to get better at Python and JS Frameworks.
Currently the application scrapes RightStufAnime and Robert's Anime Corner Store website (maybe add more later) for manga and light novel data of a particular series that is given by the user through a custom GUI then outputs the data to a CSV file and into a seperate window with search capabilities.
  - Multithreaded support to simultaeniously get the data from both websites at the same time instead of 1 at a time
