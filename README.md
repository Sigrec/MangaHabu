# MangaHabu
Website designed for Manga/Light Novel collectors in mind!

A side project I decided to do to start learning web scraping and using dif APIs in general as well as web dev stuff. Also to get better at Python and JS Frameworks


MangaHabu V1
- Scrape RightStufAnime and Robert's Anime Corner Store (maybe add more later) for manga and light novel data of a particular series that is given by the user. 
- (This one seems kinda yikes considering the title formatting for the websites aren't the same) Then compare the data and ouput all of the volumes with there title, price, and website to a CSV file for the lowest volume prices
